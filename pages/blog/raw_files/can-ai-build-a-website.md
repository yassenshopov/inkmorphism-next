# Can an AI Build a Website?

![Image](%placeholder%)

When developing an online presence, before anything else, a creator needs to be able to answer the question; “Can I Build a Website?” From the very beginning, building a website was a hefty investment of time and expertise.

If you wanted a website, you need to have:

- ► A coder who could put the elements of the website together in a way that plays well with computers
- ► An asset designer or asset library to pull graphics from, and
- ► Someone to write the content that would fill the website itself.

In more recent years, this process has been made easier than ever by the help of building block website design services such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/). In this sense, the building block function of building a website would consist of already created assets and organization schemes which the web master would pick and choose from to create their own website. But with the technological advancements of just the last year, this process has once again evolved.

Enter, AI (artificial intelligence). By use of AI, a computer program/algorithm can now make design choices and create content for users as opposed to needing a human every step of the way. Previous advancements were all about convenience of making design choices based off of a library of assets that were already created by humans. Now with the improvements in AI, every web designer can have a perfectly unique website that fits both the needs of their customers or audience, and their unique sensibilities.

Today, we’ll give a brief overview of AI website content design and how it can be used to its fullest potential to save time, money, and effort on the path to making a website or landing page which rivals the biggest names in your field.

## How to use AI in Web Development?

As far as technology has progressed, we aren’t at the point where there’s just one button someone needs to press and an AI does all the work of research, development, planning, and design. (Anyone who says otherwise is trying to fool you into buying something from them.) But we are pretty close! Let’s take a look at how AI can benefit the speed of web development, consistency in design, personalization, and reduced errors.

First, speed and efficiency. As noted earlier, the process of involving one or more web professionals to get together a website was a tedious and elaborate process that needed to wait on availability of all parties to agree on changes. Now that this process can be boiled down to just a webmaster and the AI, changes move as fast as the user can request them. In fact, tools like [ScreenshotOne](https://screenshotone.com/) are already available which can preview web design changes as you make them, saving time on reloads and speeding up the web design process.

Next, consistency of design. While it would certainly be possible to have the same agency design a series of websites on a boutique basis, ensuring they all have the same look and feel, AI has drastically streamlined the process of standardizing web layouts and design features without needing the agency price tag. The power of AI means being able to generate slight variations on the same visuals and options to create websites that all fit a cohesive theme or brand without breaking the bank.

Then, there’s customization and personalization for content for users. Let’s say this website isn’t just for your own personal business. Instead, your work consists of designing websites for multiple different companies using your time and effort and know-how. This is a situation where having multiple websites that all look or act the same would be a detriment, but you need results done yesterday. What can you do? Turn to AI like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) for help. Specific asks, branding styles, and features may have taken several weeks (or even months!) to produce in the past, but now with AI can be turned around in a single day. This benefit goes doubly for any requested edits, as well! The AI has no frustrations with suggesting dozens of alternatives for a choosy client to peruse. This makes the client happy, you happy, and the AI happy (or at least as much as an ai can even be happy, that is.)

Lastly, reducing errors and enhancing usability. Standards on improving SEO (Search Engine Optimization) will tell you that the slower a website takes to load, the more users are getting frustrated and navigating away from your page. While it takes some technical ability in the field of web development to be able to tighten up performance and catch usability bugs to make the user experience as perfect as possible, AI can patch up those issues without any prior experience. Maybe the order in which assets are loaded are slowing down your pages, or certain formatting issues are keeping web pages from performing at their best. As you sit here reading this article today, you may not know offhand how to fix those problems. Or even if you do, fixing them may take hours of your time. But with the impressive gains in AI technology, those problems may take less than five minutes for an AI to both identify and fix.

All this in mind, do know that AI is far from infallible. While it can produce content exceptionally quickly, you will need to fact check produced content that it is error-free and doesn’t invent facts or figures out of thin air.

*That is very much not a correct answer to that question.*

While these capabilities are certainly handy to be able to reference, what does that actually mean for web design?

## What does an AI for Web Content Do?

AI can work quickly and with a wide variety of expertise. But that expertise is only as good as how its used. You can’t really just log into chatGPT and ask it to make a website for you from scratch. But other more specialized tools exist which can separately design web images, website textual content, web layouts, and iteratively test websites against competitors. Let’s take a look at each one-by-one.

### AI For Image Generation

The two most common forms of AI generated content are visual and textual. For example, if you’ve scrolled past an AI generated work of art, you’re already familiar with how AI can produce digital images on a moment’s notice. This power can be harnessed for web design to be able to quickly fill out a website with images, photos, logos, and icons- all without needing to pay for a resource pack or graphic designer. This puts the power of visual language into the hands of anyone who is interested, equalizing the play field between amateurs, hobbyists & large scale corporations in terms of being able to make a web presence.

Some notable examples:

- [Midjourney](https://discord.com/invite/midjourney)
- [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/)
- [Leonardo](https://app.leonardo.ai/auth/login)
- [Dall-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2)
- [Dream by WOMBO](https://dream.ai/)

### AI for Text Generation

The other most common form of AI generated content, besides the visual content mentioned above, is textual content. This is where you’ve probably already met our good friend chatGPT, able to spit out recommendations, facts, and comparisons just like a chat with an expert may otherwise provide. In much the same way, AI is able to fill in the textual gaps of a website to make it feel complete. Even better, AI is able to quickly generate textual content at scale, so filling out 1,000 different product descriptions can take place in an hour rather than several weeks of human work.

The most popular text generating AIs are:

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Zyro](https://zyro.com/ai/content-generator)
- [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/)

### AI for Web Layouts

Now for the AI uses you may be less familiar with. Using AI technology to generate web layouts allows everyday laypeople to have stunning web design and usability without needing to hire an agency to put the website together for them. An AI will follow not only best practices, but also market trends to generate websites which both fit the bill for a particular product but also are on the cutting edge of what’s fashionable in web design. This opens the door wide open to making anyone and everyone able to have their own website with every bell and whistle they could ever ask for.

Current market leaders are:

- [Midjourney](https://discord.com/invite/midjourney)
- [Designs.AI](https://designs.ai/en)
- [Zyro](https://zyro.com/)

### AI for Testing and Iteration

Last but not least, AI emboldens everyday people to not just design a website, but to create a web page that is competitive in their market corner without a fancy degree or years of study. Let’s say you want to start a coffee company, and want to best compete with the frontrunner in your market space, Schmarbucks. Instead of only being able to compete on price or customer service, your web site can also compete with the help of AI. AI knows every trick in the book for assessing where your competitor Schmarbucks is lacking on the web design front, and how to appeal to customers who are fed up with their poor website experience. This allows you or anyone to be competitive in terms of online user experience (UX/UI) without any expert training or cost.

*Here’s an example of using competitor’s websites for market research inside chatGPT!*

## The Need for Human Element in AI Web Design

While all these use cases are certainly appealing in how much they are benefitted for AI assistance, that doesn’t necessarily mean that every website will become 100% AI content.

For example, people are quickly discovering just how efficient AI is at writing blog posts which can juice the SEO of a website. While it is possible to spit out content this way, people can easily feel when content was expressly written by AI versus words written by human hand. This connection and empathy is easily lost and difficult for a brand to recoup. There’s a time and place for letting AI completely take over the process of content creation, but front-to-back writing tasks are best left to humans.

Consider as well that AI in general is trained on thousands upon thousands of examples of existing content. That means that it can only make content based on things it has already seen, limiting its ability to come up with creative or never-before-seen ideas that will completely shake the digital world. Now, not every website needs to be so unique and creative in that sense. The true power of AI is in shortening the dev time of digital creation which doesn’t need to be unique or groundbreaking. If you’ve ever heard the phrase that “you don’t need to reinvent the wheel”, this is a dozen times more true for AI use and capabilities. AI is best suited to minimizing busy work and putting together results which get most of the way towards a completed product. Remember that hypothetical from the beginning of the article, about hitting a button and having a full-fledged website appear? You don’t want that, as it would be boring and bog standard with nothing that sets it apart, or missing necessary pieces that you know need to be included but a random AI would not.

All that in mind, AI is still immensely useful and able to save billions of man hours when it comes to web design and development. But there are caveats to its use that need to be considered as well.

## In closing

The advent of AI has been transformative to say the least. All kinds of design and development are now possible which were previously either prohibitively expensive or out of reach for the average creator. Now with the digital tools provided by AI, anyone and everyone can have the website that best suits them and their audience in a moment’s notice.
